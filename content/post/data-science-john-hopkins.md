title: "JHU Data Science Specialization"
---

I was keen to continue learning after the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng and Coursera was working for me on my long commutes to and from work, so I decided to move on to the Data Science specialization from John Hopkins University. I did deliberate for a while about whether to learn R or python at this point but was swayed by some positive feedback on this specialization and R generally from some former students I came into contact with, and the promise of learning the complete data science pipeline including use of Git Hub, data wrangling and visualization as well as the more glamorous machine learning modules. 


I took 8 of the 10 courses required for the specialization as below:  

 * The Data Scientists Toolbox.  [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/c99cdaa4975e7bc1c55c965f493c7a7a)
 * R Programming.  [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/2a5a90892e802f9e284c0614c4098394)
 * Getting and Cleaning Data.  [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/0ad334857976ad24f80b9e4b0c812231)
 * Exploratory Data Analysis.  [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/0a126ed6b8bab15867c628a64f061bf0)
 * Reproducible Research.  [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/bb369d49a0f4949d1c845a23dfcaa83c)
 * Statistical Inference.  [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/ad1af21035cbcbb86ed8a562b67ed5f6)
 * Regression Models.  [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/dcac607eebb34f5fd0c6417bc4e7dcbd)
