title: "Deep Learning Specialization"

---

As soon as I heard news of the release of the new Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera by Andrew Ng in August 2017, I was sold on it. Having spent months diligently coding in R and studying the rigours of statistical learning, I was ready for a switch to python and some cutting edge deep learning, especially after the somewhat underwhelming experience of using neural networks in R with the claret package.

I had studied neural networks in the Artificial Intelligence class of my Open University computing degree and was intrigued by them, this deep learning specialization arrived at just the right time to bring me up to speed with recent developments and techniques in the field.

Overall I really enjoyed the specialization and its assignments, Andrew Ng is a great teacher and role model but the new coursera format of monthly payments for access to course materials was frustrating. Once I had finished the specialization I couldnt access the course materials any more and this was definitely a negative as it wasn't possible to refresh my memory on topics. I also found that I missed the peer review aspect to assignments as well as the more rigorous apprach of traditional statistical learning from the JHU Data Science specialization however in all I am glad that I took this specialization.

The specialization was formed of 5 courses:

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning - teaching the foundations of deep learning, bulding fully connected deep neural nets in python using numpy arrays, teaching the mechanisms of back propogation and stochastic gradient descent.

2. Improving Deep Neural Netwroks: Hyper Paramet tuning, Regularixzation and Optimization. - this course brings in some tensorflow rather than working with numpy arrays and introduces concepts such as using L2 regularisation, dropout, batch normalization and gradient checking. Best practices are explained for implementing deep learning models with Tensorflow including to setting up train/validation/test sets , analyzing bias/variance in models and mini-batch gradient descent.

3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects - A shorter more personal course where Andrew Ng shares his experiences of building and shipping deep learning products and explains common errors in deep learning projects and how to best spend time and resources to effectively reduce model error rates. Andrew goes through common pitfalls that have derailed projects and scenarios such as when not to focus on collecting more data.

4. Convolutional Neural Networks - After focusing on fully connected networks in the first few courses it was time to take a deeper dive into computer vision with CNNs, there were great assignments implementing CNNs for facial recognition style transfer in artistic images and for object detection. I really enjoyed this particular course as it was my first exposure to these types of networks.

5. Sequence Models - This course focused on sequence algorithms such as Recurrent Neural Networks, GRUs and LSTMs and their application in NLP, audio applications, speech recognition and music generation. I also enjoyed this course but it felt more of a survey course than the others and i was keen to learn more about these topics.
