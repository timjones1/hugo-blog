      <description>I have wanted to create and deploy a toy deep learning image classification model for a while and fasti.ai gets straight into the nitty gritty in lesson 2 of their deep learning for coders course. You can adapt the code in the fast book notebooks and get a model up and running quickly and easily. I decided to create a rowing boat classifier, as it is my first DL model I kept the classification relatively simple, classifying single sculls(one person in the boat with two blades) from quads (four people rowing, each with two blades)</description>

      <description>I was keen to continue learning after my introduction to ML with Andrew Ng, I liked the Coursera format and so I decided to move on to the Data Science specialization from John Hopkins University.
I had deliberated about whether to learn R or python at this point but was swayed by some positive feedback on this specialization and R generally from some friends, and by the prospect of learning about data science pipelines, Git Hub, data wrangling and visualization as well as the more glamorous machine learning modules.</description>

      <title>  Machine Learning with Andrew Ng</title>

      <description>This course on Coursera was my first introduction to Machine Learning way back in 2016, Andrew Ng is an inspirational teacher and his now famous course covers the basics of machine learning using Octave or Matlab. I chose to complete the course in Matlab but Andrew really teaches the foundations of machine learning with this course and the tools used are less important than the ideas put forward of which there are many, Andrew strives to give the student an &amp;ldquo;intuition&amp;rdquo; of how the main machine learning algorithms work.</description>
