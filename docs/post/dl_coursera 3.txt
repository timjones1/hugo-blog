As soon as I heard news of the release of the new Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera by Andrew Ng in August 2017 I was sold on it. Having 
spent months diligently coding in R and studying the rigours of statistical learning, I was ready for a switch to python and some cutting edge deep learning. 
My experience of Neural networks in the claret package in R had been somewhat underwhelming.
