i have wnated to delpoy my own deep learning image classification model for some time and the new fasti.ai course gets straight into the nitty gritty in lesson 2 of the deep learning for coders course. You can adapt the code in the fast book notebooks and get a model up and running quickly and easily, in my case that model just wasnt very good initially:

 - rowing images are not well classified on bing, alot of incorrectly classified images and drawings / pictures of empty boats that were bringin down the accuracy scores. 

- initial accurcay was only approx 75% between single sculls and quads, something very simple to tell the difference between by counting the number of people in the boat and also the number of oars. 

- demo of bing images was 7 days so had to get other sources of images, managed to retrieve some additional images and tidy them up by running a base model and checking the top losses, recategorizing and deleting where appropriate, getting a better handle on file system manipulation and file renaming to shoe horn the extra images into the fat .ai datablock.
