      <title>  Rowing Classifier with fast.ai</title>

      <description>I have wanted to create and deploy a toy deep learning image classification model for a while and fasti.ai gets straight into the nitty gritty in lesson 2 of their deep learning for coders course. You can adapt the code in the fast book notebooks and get a model up and running quickly and easily. I decided to create a rowing boat classifier, as it is my first DL model I kept the classification relatively simple, classifying single sculls(one person in the boat with two blades) from quads (four people rowing, each with two blades)</description>
