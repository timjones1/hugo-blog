      <description>I was keen to continue learning after my introduction to ML with Andrew Ng, I liked the Coursera format and so I decided to move on to the Data Science specialization from John Hopkins University.
I had deliberated about whether to learn R or python at this point but was swayed by some positive feedback on this specialization and R generally from some friends, and by the prospect of learning about data science pipelines, Git Hub, data wrangling and visualization as well as the more glamorous machine learning modules.</description>

      <description>This course on Coursera was my first introduction to Machine Learning way back in 2016, Andrew Ng is an inspirational teacher and his now famous course covers the basics of machine learning using Octave or Matlab. I chose to complete the course in Matlab but Andrew really teaches the foundations of machine learning with this course and the tools used are less important than the ideas put forward of which there are many, Andrew strives to give the student an &amp;ldquo;intuition&amp;rdquo; of how the main machine learning algorithms work.</description>
