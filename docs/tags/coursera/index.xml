      <description>This course on Coursera was my first introduction to Machine Learning way back in 2016, Andrew Ng is an inspirational teacher and his now famous course covers the basics of machine learning using Octave or Matlab. I chose to complete the course in Matlab but Andrew really teaches the foundations of machine learning with this course and the tools used are less important than the ideas put forward of which there are many, Andrew strives to give the student an &amp;ldquo;intuition&amp;rdquo; of how the main machine learning algorithms work.</description>
